## Workflow

-Clicking the the list of places in the patronise will page render the places page containing the corresponding place and the card with the details of the place

## Future Improvements

-From the figma design file, a map is to be implemented with the google maps api key. The map will be implemented in the patronise page and the places page
Google requires having a console account with your card details attached to activate this particular api key.
-A mobile view for each section in the figma design file should be created as well. This well imporove workflow and user experience.
